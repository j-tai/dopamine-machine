Fly around, shoot polygons, and one day even prestige?? (when it's implemented)

## Prepare dependencies

`npm` still needs to be installed manually.

```sh
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

## Linting

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Build and run locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

# sv

TODO remove template stuff below here

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv create --template minimal --types ts --add prettier eslint vitest="usages:unit,component" --install npm ./
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
